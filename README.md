## FAQ

- __How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?__

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.
