     # Deployment

    In order to deploy the contracts on a blockchain run ganache or anyother network
      deploy to ganache truffle migrate --network develop

     # Start web server

         npm start
            Starting the development server...

## Improvement

	- Our NFT factory is approching 24576 bytes, the limit introduced in Spurious Dragon. We might need to down-size this file to increase gas deployment efficiency.
	- We decided to handle fungible token using ERC 1155 implementation. However, we did not have the time to include those functionalities in our app. We are going to implement this feature in the near future.
	- We also decided to optimise IPFS upload to make the procedure easy, efficient and error free.
	- We currently do not handle events, pop up for user interaction , and some error management still missing, we will add those features soon.

## FAQ

- __How do I use this with Ganache (or any other network)?__

  The Truffle project is set to deploy to Ganache by default. If you'd like to change this, it's as easy as modifying the Truffle config file! Check out [our documentation on adding network configurations](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#networks). From there, you can run `truffle migrate` pointed to another network, restart the React dev server, and see the change take place.
